* Starter kit yasnippet

Yasnippet is a snippet expansion system for Emacs. It uses short phrases and the tab key to trigger the insertion of frequently-used snippets of code or text in your document.

** Company Mode
Auto-completion of text and code. 

We use the `:with` keyword to include dabbrev in every backend, which gives us completion from everything that's in the buffer (and other open buffers).

#+source: company-mode
#+begin_src emacs-lisp 

;;Use C-TAB to complete. We put this in eval-after-load 
;; because otherwise some modes will try to override our settings.
(require 'company)
;; set to 0 to prevent completion starting automatically 
;; (setq company-idle-delay 0)
;; cancel if input doesn't match
(setq company-require-match nil)
;; complete using C-TAB
(global-set-key (kbd "<C-tab>") 'company-complete)
;; use C-n and C-p to cycle through completions
;; (define-key company-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'company-complete)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-n") 'company-select-next)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "<tab>") 'company-complete-common)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "C-p") 'company-select-previous)
(define-key company-active-map (kbd "<backtab>") 'company-select-previous)
;; enable math completions
(require 'company-math)
;; company-mode completions for ess
;; (require 'company-ess)

;;(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-math-symbols-latex)
;; put company-capf at the beginning of the list
(require 'company-capf)
(setq company-backends
      (delete-dups (cons 'company-capf company-backends)))

;; ;; disable dabbrev
;; (delete 'company-dabbrev company-backends)

** Autocomplete
We use company mode, as initiated above, but here's a working auto-complete setup as an alternative. Don't use company mode and autocomplete together. To switch from company-mode to autocomplete, move the `tangle: no` from the `begin_src` line below up to the corresponding line in the `company-mode` section above. Then open the `starter-kit-elpa.org` file, uncomment the `autocomplete` and `ac-` extensions there, and restart Emacs.

#+source:  autocomplete
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
  (require 'auto-complete)
  (require 'auto-complete-config)
  (global-auto-complete-mode t)
  (add-to-list 'ac-dictionary-directories (expand-file-name "auto-complete" dotfiles-dir))
  (setq ac-modes (append ac-modes '(org-mode))) 
  (ac-config-default)
  (define-key ac-complete-mode-map [tab] 'ac-expand)
  (setq ac-auto-start 4)
  (ac-flyspell-workaround)
  (define-key ac-mode-map (kbd "M-TAB") 'auto-complete)
  (define-key ac-completing-map (kbd "C-c h") 'ac-quick-help)  
  (add-hook 'html-mode-hook 'ac-html-enable)
